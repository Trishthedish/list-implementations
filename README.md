# Practice Together
Together we will write array-list.rb where we will simulate what happens "under the hood" with Ruby's Array object.

Then we will also take a look at linked-list.rb and see how the _implementation_ is different and uses nodes instead of a native array to store data.

# Assignment
Do your best to write `include?` and `size` in `linked-list.rb`, modeling after `display`. If you are feeling ambitious, write `max` as well.

display code as size. If you get one you csn get them all
